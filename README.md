This project applies **Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz)** to a universe of **FAANG stocks**  
(**AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, META, NFLX**) using daily market data from 2020 to 2023.

It explores how different portfolio optimization strategies perform in terms of **return, risk, and efficiency**:
- **Equal-weight portfolio** (naive benchmark)  
- **Minimum-variance portfolio** (risk minimization objective)  
- **Maximum-Sharpe portfolio** (risk-adjusted return maximization)

Using the **mean‚Äìvariance optimization framework**, each portfolio is constructed under realistic constraints  
(no short-selling, full investment) and compared across key **performance metrics**:  
annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and portfolio weights.

The analysis demonstrates how optimization improves the **risk‚Äìreturn efficiency** of a portfolio  
even within a concentrated equity universe like FAANG.  
Visual outputs include the **efficient frontier**, **weights allocation**, and **performance comparison** charts.

## Analyse  


1. **Benchmark Portfolio (Equal-Weight)
   - Naive allocation: each asset weight = 1/N (here N=5 ‚Üí 20%).

2. Minimum Volatility Portfolio 
- Mean‚Äìvariance optimization (Markowitz framework).

- Objective: find the portfolio weights w = (w1, w2, ‚Ä¶, wn) that minimize the variance of returns.


Mathematical formulation:
Minimize:  œÉ_p¬≤ = w·µÄ Œ£ w
Subject to: ‚àë wi = 1  and  wi ‚â• 0

Where:
œÉ_p¬≤ = variance of the portfolio
Œ£ = covariance matrix of asset returns
wi = weight of asset i

This portfolio provides the lowest possible risk (volatility) for a given set of assets.

3. Maximum Sharpe Portfolio 
- Mean‚Äìvariance optimization with Sharpe ratio as objective.

- Objective: maximize risk-adjusted return, defined as the Sharpe ratio.

Sharpe ratio formula (risk-free rate Rf = 0% here):
S = (E[R_p] ‚Äì Rf) / œÉ_p  = E[R_p] / œÉ_p

Mathematical formulation:
Maximize:  S = (w·µÄ Œº) / ‚àö(w·µÄ Œ£ w)
Subject to: ‚àë wi = 1  and  wi ‚â• 0

Where:
E[R_p] = expected return of the portfolio
Œº = vector of expected returns of assets
œÉ_p = portfolio volatility

This portfolio gives the best trade-off between return and risk.

4. Comparison & Reporting 
- Compare different portfolios (Equally Weighted, Minimum Volatility, Maximum Sharpe).

- Metrics used: growth of $1 invested, annualized expected return, annualized volatility, Sharpe ratio, portfolio weights.


Mathematical indicators:
E[R_p] = expected annualized return
œÉ_p = annualized volatility
S = Sharpe ratio = E[R_p] / œÉ_p

This comparison highlights the efficiency of optimized portfolios versus the simple equally weighted benchmark.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology 

- **Returns**: arithmetic daily returns (`pct_change()`), annualized √ó252.  
- **Volatility**: standard deviation of returns, annualized √ó‚àö252.  
- **Sharpe Ratio**: (Return ‚àí Risk-Free) √∑ Volatility, risk-free = 0%.  
- **Optimization**: `scipy.optimize.minimize` (SLSQP), constraints:  
  - sum(weights) = 1
  - weights ‚â• 0

##  Results

### Annualized Performance Summary 

| Portfolio      | Return | Volatility | Sharpe (rf=0) |
|----------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| Equal-Weight   | 23.60% | 32.69%     | 0.72          |
| Min-Vol        | 25.01% | 30.31%     | 0.83          |

| AAPL   | 20.0         | 39.84   | 78.74      |
| AMZN   | 20.0         | 14.91   | 0.00       |
| GOOGL  | 20.0         | 38.29   | 19.97      |
| META   | 20.0         | 0.00    | 0.00       |

## üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways

- **Naive diversification (Equal-Weight)** underperformed both optimized portfolios.   

- **Min-Vol Portfolio** delivered lower risk and improved Sharpe, favoring AAPL + GOOGL.    

- **Max-Sharpe Portfolio** concentrated in AAPL (‚âà79%) and GOOGL (‚âà20%), achieving the best Sharpe.  

- Even within a concentrated FAANG universe, **optimization improves efficiency**.
